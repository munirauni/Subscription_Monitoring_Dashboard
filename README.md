# PROGRAM SUBSCRIPTION MONITORING DASHBOARD

The main objective of developing this project is to create a real-time dashboard to monitor and be alert with programs subscription status (eg: active, expired, soon to expire). This will save time as compared to filter manually through spreadsheet.

Besides, this dashboard is built to instantly answer important questions/requests which are frequently asked by top management such as:

1) Amount of current program subscribers.
2) Distribution of their county.
3) Business industry distribution.
4) Subscription year in the program.


## Data Source

Datasets were prepared and cleaned in Google Sheets then were imported to Google Looker Studio for visualization.
